scir-core

Overview
- Core utilities for SciR (SciPy rebuilt for Rust): numeric tolerance helpers, complex number utilities, and a reusable `assert_close!` macro used across crates.

Highlights
- Consistent floating-point comparison via `assert_close!` for slices and ndarray arrays (real and complex).
- Minimal, battle-tested building blocks shared by `scir-fft`, `scir-signal`, `scir-optimize`, and others.
